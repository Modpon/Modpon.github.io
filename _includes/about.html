                    <p>Demand for biological vegetables and fruit is up. Food-consciousness makes people want to eat healthier and raises restaurants needs for working with better products. Current production-methods are out of date. Why should these products be grown in large greenhouses, after which they are transported by polluting vehicles to reach consumers?</p>
                    <p>Citygardening has the future. Even in small apartments, consumers can grow their own food, all year long. Empty premises can be used to produce at a large scale. Short routes of transport, low labor needs and continuing harvests.</p>

                    <p>Modpon makes growing your own vegetables and fruit approachable. Through hydroponics vegetables, fruit, herbs and other crops can be grown in small spaces.
